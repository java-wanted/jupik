### Introduction

There is a type File in Java. An instance of this type describes a path to
a file or a directory.

The File type provides some operations, e.g. an operation to check the file
exists on VFS, to check it is the directory of some file, to create the file,
to iterate over a list of files within a directory.

Solve the following VFS problem:

- Create a few nested directories, *d1/d2/d3*

- Create a few files within the directory *d3*

- Print the absolute patches of files whose names start with the letter *A*
