### JUnit

In the food production to check that a logic satisties some expectation auto
tests are used. In Java a library JUnit could be used to write such tests.

JDK does not contains the library JUnit. To compile a probram with such external
libraries it is possible to use so called build tools, e.g. Gradle and Maven.

In general the idea of auto testing is:

- To provide an expected result of execution of some logic

- To calculate the actual result of the execution

- To validate that the actual result exuals the expected one.

Solve the following computational issue:

- Create a class that implements the following operations:

    - Addition, multiplication, division of two double values

    - Rising a double value at the power of two

- Provide auto tests for each operation
